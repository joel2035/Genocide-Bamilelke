            La’akam is the most sacred place of the Bamiléké, and it belongs to all of them. It is where the
            most illustrious Bamileke ancestors are buried and honored, and it is the place where princes
            are trained to be kings. <br>
            La’akam is also a call to excellence throughout one’s life. In the face of adversity, it has
            been used by generations of Bamiléké as a rallying point to think deeply about our survival as a
            culture. It was in this spirit that we created La’akam in October 2019: to remember the genocide
            of the Bamiléké and to build the strength of our people. <br>
            This vision of La’akam can be thus summarized in one question: WHEN WILL THE BAMILEKÉ BRING
            ABOUT THEIR RENAISSANCE? La‘akam inspires the Bamileke to not only survive, but to create the
            conditions for their flourishing. <br>
            This renaissance must emerge from the center of Bamileke civilization, and it begins in the
            sacred house that is found in all Bamileke communities. This is the forum where Bamileke sons
            and daughters come together to participate in society and contribute to the key issues facing
            the people. <br>
            To achieve this, we say in La’akam that there is neither English nor French Bamiléké; not
            Muslim, Christian, or animist Bamiléké; neither UPC, CPDM, nor MCR Bamiléké. There is only ONE
            BAMILEKE PEOPLE, descendants of the land of Tikar, indivisible, united by blood, who—like all
            the peoples of the world—seek to pursue happiness, live their dreams, and help the next
            generation to build a better world.
