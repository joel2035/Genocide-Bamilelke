            The history of genocide must be known
          </h3>
        </div>

        <p class="book__text">The Bamileke martyrs of the genocide of 1955-1971 are until today considered by history to
          be common criminals, and it is up to their descendants to redefine their legacy. The aim of this commemoration
          is to identify the goals of their fight, the circumstances of their genocide, and the responsibility of
          France. All of this is part of a project to retell the history of the Bamiléké people in their own words.
          The history of the Bamileke genocide also has implications for the situation in Cameroon today. There are
          direct links between the impact of the genocide, the ongoing appropriation of the living space of the
          Bamileke, and the landslides to which they are victims of throughout Cameroon.</p>

            Funerals for the martyrs must be held
          </h3>
        </div>

        <p class="book__text">Bamiléké culture prescribes that after the death of an individual, the community holds a
          funeral for them. This funeral is composed of certain rituals which allow the dead to access the afterlife
          with ease in order to intercede for the living with God (SI’H).
          But for those killed in the Bamileke genocide—including heads of families, eminent notables of the royal
          courts, kings, and people from all areas of society—these funerals were never held. This interruption of the
          spiritual and cultural requirements prescribed by Bamiléké customs has blocked our elders from becoming
          ancestors in our tradition, and it is therefore essential that we begin these funeral rites as soon as
          possible.</p>

            France must not be allowed to write the history of Cameroon</h3>
        </div>

        <p class="book__text">France has begun to write the history of its involvement in Cameroon by setting up a joint
          commission led by a French historian and a Cameroonian musician. We believe that France aims to rewrite the
          history of its war against Cameroon in order to disqualify any facts that could implicate it in committing
          genocide. France did not only take steps to mask and conceal the atrocities they committed against the
          Bamiléké people; it is today rewriting the history of these events to give the impression that the genocide it
          perpetrated was only a civil war between Cameroonians.
          However, there is overwhelming evidence demonstrating that France not only instigated this war, but also
          worked to ensure that the Bamiléké people would be decimated in order to eliminate resistance to France’s
          exploitation of the mining and economic resources of Cameroon. These facts must be made known to the world so
          that France can be held accountable for its actions against the Bamileke people and all of Cameroon.</p>
